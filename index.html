<h3> WEIRD MUSIC</h3>
</div>
<div class = "paragraph1">
<p> So first ya got to go on to spotify cuz it's free and stuff. Then you have to search up my playlist and it's called Arnav is Cool because i am of course.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph2">
<p> After that if you apreciate music here are some good songs for you:
</p>
</div>
<div class = "Johnny">
<h2>John williams music:</h2>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class = "johnparagraph">
<p> John williams has created many different compositions, all different unlike many other composers. One reason for this is because he used to be a jazz pianist.
 This makes him different from composers like Hans Zimmer.</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph3">
<p> Songs by John williams are always great. I enjoy his star wars ones the most because I can relate to that as a star wars fan. Here are some that I like a lot.  
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph4">
<p>Binary Sunset is really calming tune.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph5">
<p> The imperial march is a classic. Extremely original tune, great incorporation of the flute and violins in the middle, just amazing.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph6">
<p> Love Pledge and the Arena is a very long song, but the orchestra goes everywhere. The beggining is just like the calm before the storm. 2:40 to 6:30 is a really underrated march.
    The rest is litterally the orchestra showing how great they are.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph7">
<p> Duel of the fates. GREAT composition. The cellos have a really nice touch. A choir carries the melody, which is extremely different. Lots of parts make you think its over,
    but it starts going again.
</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class = "paragraph8">
<p> The spark. Even if the sequels were garbage this song was really good. It's really great as it shows great buildup to something greater and uses a leigtmotif way back in history.
</p>
<br>
<p> There are so much more but those are my highlights
</div>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<div class = "Johnny">
    <h2>Kevin Kiner music:</h2>
    </div>
<br>
<br>
<div class = Kevin>
<p>Kevin Kiner's music consists mainly of the clone wars tv show, which is 7 seasons long and has over 100 episodes. IF you listen to his music without the context, you won't be able to enjoy it to its fullest.</p>
<br>
<p>The clones leigtmotif. This leigtmotif is a great one as it shows how the jedi and the clones are brothers in war.</p>
<br>
<p>The bad batch's theme. It shows the strength of the bad batch and the skill they hold.</p>
<br>
<p>Victory and death. The sadness of the clones' betrayal is put in full force with this song.</p>
<br>
<p>As Kevin Kiner has scored more than john williams, for me they don't stand out as much. Also I really don't want to do anymore so :P</p>
